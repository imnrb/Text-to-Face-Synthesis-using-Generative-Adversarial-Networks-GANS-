# Text-to-Face Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANS)
Objective: To generate high-resolution, lifelike facial images using user-given text descriptions
without any disentanglements using GANs.
Below is one such example which we ran on our environment

Text-to-face generation using Deep Fusion GAN (DFGAN) is a promising approach for
synthesizing high-quality realistic facial images from textual descriptions. This technology
has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications, from creating lifelike avatars
in video games and virtual reality environments to generate images of missing persons in
forensic investigations.
